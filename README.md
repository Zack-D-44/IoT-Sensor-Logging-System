# IoT-Sensor-Logging-System-For-Electric-Go-Kart
A Python based sensor logging package that is desinged for monitoring and analysing telemetry data from an electric go-kart. The system collects data using a Rasberry Pi Sense HAT and visualises the data using Pygal, providing insights into performance to help in go-kart optimisation. Creating this system was a part of my coursework for my IoT module, but I belive that I went above an beyond therefore I have posted it to my GitHub.

## Features
- Real time data collection using a Raspberry Pi Sense Hat
- Data transmission using WebSockets
- Data visualisation using Pygal

## Installation and Setup
- Clone the repository using the `git clone` command
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd repo-name`
- Install the requirements by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
